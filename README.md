# Shopping List
### Made in React Native during Traversy Media code along
*Note: It's not much right now but it will be a full-fledged shopping list soon*

## To test out:
* Fork and clone repo
* Make sure you have all the necessary software downloaded and set up:
  * Android Studio w/ correct SDK version as per current React Native version needs, etc.
  * Traversy Media has a great video on how to get set up for React Native development [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRLLjlpy0r4&t=615s 'Getting Set Up')
* Run ```npm install``` from project root directory
* Run ```npm start```
* Once application has started, you can run ```npx react-native run-android``` or ```npx react-native run-ios``` depending on your chosen development enviroment . . .
  * OR you can open android emulator/ios simulator manually
  
## Brief feature run down:

- [x] User can add items to shopping list
- [x] User can delete items from shopping list
* Todo:
  - [ ] Shopping list data is persistent
  - [ ] Data persistance chosen (LocalStorage? Database?)
  * Questions relating to this:
    * Do I want users to have their own shopping list account, to be able to sign in to, for security purposes? (If someone other than themselves get a hold of their phone, etc.)
    * Am I looking for sufficient or proficient?
